# DAIS-Framework
Dental Inlay Restoration Framework

Code for inlay generation.

The data volume of 3D tooth inlay can be downloaded from

Note that,

DAIS-DuNet.py  is a dual discriminator;

DAISNet.py  is deep dental inlay restoration network;

Depth iamge.zip  is the depth image of the occlusal surface by orthogonal projection method;

Occlusal Groove.jpg  is the depth image of the occlusal groove by orthogonal projection method;

Only_Data_samply.jpg  is a depth image sample;

Test 1.py  is a test code that contains perceptual loss;

data-0006.jpg  is a depth image sample;

pix2pix4.py  is pix2pix model, which takes four images as input.
